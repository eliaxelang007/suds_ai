(Including 6 Steps to Become One)\\n\\nZamboni drivers are ice resurfacing drivers who work at ice rinks to prepare the surface so people can skate on it safely. While ice resurfacers' primary responsibilities relate to preparing the ice for skaters, they also have various maintenance responsibilities. If you're considering a career as an ice resurfacing driver, learning more about this profession and the steps you can take to become one is beneficial. In this article, we explain what a Zamboni driver is, share some of their duties, discuss the work environment, and explain how to become one.\\n\\n## What is a Zamboni driver?\\n\\nA Zamboni driver, or an ice resurfacing driver, ensures the ice is in an ideal condition and safe for people to use for skating. These individuals use ice resurfacing machines, such as the Zamboni machine, to complete their tasks. Although there are other ice resurfacing devices people can use to resurface the ice, Zamboni is a brand that people frequently use, and the term has become synonymous with the equipment.\\n\\n## What does an ice-resurfacing driver do?\\n\\nIce resurfacing drivers typically have the following responsibilities:\\n\\n* ensuring the ice conditions are ideal for various events, such as hockey games or figure skating competitions\\n\\n* operating an ice resurfacing machine to maintain ideal ice conditions\\n\\n* adhering to safety precautions while using the Zamboni\\n\\n* maintaining the ice resurfacing machine, which requires sharpening the blades, charging or refilling the power source, and refilling holding tanks\\n\\n* performing preventative maintenance inspections on tools and equipment\\n\\n* creating service reports and records for materials expended and job time\\n\\n* performing general cleaning in the facility, such as mopping and sweeping the restrooms, shower areas, meeting rooms, locker rooms, and bleachers\\n\\n* changing lights, removing trash, and cleaning rink glass\\n\\n* preparing the complex for meetings and events by moving furniture, such as tables and chairs\\n\\n* maintaining the rink's grounds by weeding, mowing, edging, and trimming trees and hedges\\n\\n* raking, gathering and removing leaves, branches, and various other debris\\n\\n* assisting with salting sidewalks and snow removal\\n\\n## Ice-resurfacing driver work environment\\n\\nIf you become an ice resurfacing driver, you might work in sports complexes or arenas that hold ice rinks. People may use these ice rinks for various purposes, such as recreational skating, competitive figure skating, speed skating, or ice hockey. You may work during hours when many skaters use the rink or during a game, such as evenings and weekends. As a rink equipment driver, you may resurface the ice regularly and take about 10 minutes to condition the ice. Dressing warmly and being comfortable with others watching you complete the resurfacing is essential.\\n\\nIf you're also responsible for facility and ground maintenance, you might work outside in extreme weather, including freezing temperatures and snow. Maintaining grounds can be physically demanding, so it's essential to stay fit so you can complete your tasks without becoming injured. If you work as an ice resurfacing driver for various sports complexes, you might drive between the locations.\\n\\n## How to become a Zamboni driver\\n\\nHere are nine steps you can take if you want to follow this career path:\\n\\n* Get a high school diploma\\n    * The first step to becoming an ice resurfacing driver is to get a high school diploma or GED equivalent. While a university degree isn't a requirement for this role, many employers expect candidates to have completed high school. During your time as a student, it's beneficial to learn what you can about career opportunities in your area so you can consider job opportunities.\\n\\n* Pursue a job working at a location with an ice rink\\n    * Even as a student in high school, you may get a job at a local ice rink. You can assist with maintaining the facility and grounds or work at a concession stand. Gaining experience at a rink and developing professional relationships with existing team members can increase the likelihood of them considering you for the ice resurfacing driver position once qualified.\\n\\n* Join a recreation facilities association\\n    * If you want to become a more competitive candidate for the ice resurfacing driver role, it's beneficial to become a member of your province or territory's facilities association. For example, you can join the Ontario Recreation Facilities Association (ORFA) or the Recreation Facilities Association of British Columbia (RFABC) if you live in either of these provinces. These organizations aim to enhance the role of recreation facility professionals and provide support for members. For example, when you become a member, you can access various resources and partake in certificate programs. You can typically apply for an individual membership on the organization's website.\\n\\n*  Develop skills\\n    * While you might develop some of these skills if you decide to pursue a certificate, you can also learn from others and through practical experience on the job. For example, you might meet with the ice resurfacing driver at your local rink and observe them and ask questions. Here's a list of skills that can help you excel as an ice resurfacing driver:\\n        * driving skills\\n        * equipment maintenance\\n        * ice resurfacing and edging\\n        * mechanical knowledge\\n        * landscaping\\n        * leadership\\n        * physical fitness\\n        * time management\\n\\n* Craft your resume\\n    * Once you're ready to apply for entry-level ice resurfacing driver roles, you can craft a resume highlighting your education, relevant skills, and experience. For example, you might include the skills such as time management and driving to show your potential in the role. It's vital your ice resurfacing driver resume includes the following sections:\\n        * Contact information: This includes our name, phone number, e-mail address, and the city and province or territory where you live.\\n        \\n        * Professional summary: This introductory paragraph comprises a few sentences explaining why you're a suitable candidate for the role.\\n\\n        * Work experience: Under this header, you can include your job title, employment dates, the name of the company you worked for, and its location, followed by a bulleted list of your primary duties in each role.\\n\\n        * Education: Include the name of your school, its location, and your qualification.\\n\\n        * Skills: List any hard and soft skills you've gained that can help you excel in the ice resurfacing driver role.\\n\\n        * Certification: Feature all relevant certifications that you may have earned.\\n\\n* Apply for the ice resurfacing driver role\\n    * Once you've updated your resume and are confident it's free of errors, you can submit it to organizations hiring ice resurfaces. If you're still working at your local ice rink, you might begin by applying there. In the circumstance where you lack experience as an ice resurfacer, you might start applying to smaller, local rinks. If they don't contact you after a week, you might send a follow-up e-mail to inquire about the status of your application.\\n\\n## Ways to advance your career as a Zamboni driver\\n\\nHere are some ways you can advance your career as an ice resurfacing driver, work for notable ice rinks, and earn a more competitive salary:\\n\\n* Complete courses\\n    * If you want to work for ice rinks within larger arenas or those used by professional athletes, you can see if your local recreation facilities association offers courses to further your knowledge. For example, ORFA offers courses such as Ice Making and Painting Technologies and Ice Maintenance and Equipment Operations. Alberta's Recreation Facility Personnel (RFP) offers courses like Arena Maintenance and Natural Ice Making. These courses can help you gain more knowledge and valuable skills in the field that you can include on your resume. These certifications are typically recognized across the country.\\n\\n* Get a certification\\n    * Once you have experience as an ice resurfacing driver, you can apply for certification that proves your expertise. For example, ORFA, Recreation Connections Manitoba, and Recreation PEI offer a Certified Ice Technician (CIT) certification. Other provinces and countries recognize ORFA's CIT certification as a leading credential for ice resurfacing drivers. The National Hockey League (NHL) accepts this certification for ice resurfacing drivers who tend to the ice during professional hockey matches. You can apply by completing an application on the organization's website. Here are the requirements for pursuing a CIT through ORFA:\\n        * having an Individual Membership in the ORFA\\n        * proof of a minimum Grade 12 education\\n        * two years of full-time work experience in refrigeration operations and ice making and maintenance\\n        * completion of the courses mentioned above\\n\\n* Apply for more competitive roles\\n    * Once you've gained experience as an ice resurfacing driver, you can apply for ice resurfacer roles in larger arenas. For example, you might apply for jobs in major sports complexes or arenas that host professional hockey matches and ice skating competitions. These roles typically have more competitive salaries requiring more experience and certifications than entry-level ice resurfacing driver roles. Before applying, ensure you've updated your resume to include your latest credentials.\\n\")]\n",
